# Assignment2Simon
---------------------------------------------
At a minimum, the app should

Implement a clone of the game Simon.
Implement at least 3 variations of the game. The manual above lists the official variations of the game. You can do these 3, or find or create others.
Include an about dialog or screen that lists all developers and properly credits all sounds, images, etc.
Include a high-score system for the game.
The sequence of lights and sounds should play automatically and in a somewhat similar manner to the original game.
Must make sound. The sounds do not have to be like the original game, but buttons must each have unique sounds.
Visual clues and audio clues must be evident when Simon is showing the player the pattern to follow. Visual and audio feedback should also be evident when the user is pushing buttons.
Game mechanics must make sense. For example, when Simon is demonstrating the pattern, the player should not be able to press the buttons.
Deal with screen rotations, somehow.
Must look nice.
The app should not crash. The app should not generate any "Not responding" dialog messages.
